# Git-Demo

Author: Mansi Raj
This repository contains a demonstration of how to use git for version control. The purpose is to
illustrate the basic commands and concepts associated with using git, such as adding files to the
repository, committing changes, viewing commit history, diff'ing between versions, merging branches
and resolving conflicts.
The project consists of two main directories: "master" and "dev". The master directory
contains a single file called "readme.txt", which serves as an example of a file that
can be added to the repository. The dev directory contains additional files that are not part
of the master branch but can be merged into it if necessary.</s>
